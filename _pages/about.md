Hi! I'm **Pallekonda Naveen Kumar**, currently pursuing my M.Tech in Computer Science at the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore**, where I work under the guidance of **Prof. Ambedkar Dukkipati**. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Generative AI**, **Temporal Knowledge Graphs**, and **Sequential Modeling**, with applications in areas such as **stock market forecasting** and **low-resource language translation**.

I‚Äôve previously worked at **Cognizant** as a Full Stack Engineer Intern and Programmer Analyst Trainee, where I led the design of cloud-native systems and migration projects. I enjoy combining theoretical insights with practical implementation to build intelligent systems.


## My Work & Research

### üî¨ Research Contributions

- **Learning Long Contexts and Forecasting with Kolmogorov-Arnold Hawkes Processes (MIPR‚Äô25 ‚Äì Accepted)**  
  Introduced **KANHawkes**, a model that enhances Hawkes Processes by integrating Kolmogorov‚ÄìArnold Networks for better generalization and temporal forecasting.

- **Learning to Forecast under Dynamic External Influence (NeurIPS‚Äô25 ‚Äì Submitted)**  
  Proposed a framework that models relations in **temporal knowledge graphs** as Hawkes events using **graph attention networks**, applied to financial trend prediction.

### üìò M.Tech Thesis  
**Title:** *Modeling Heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs for Forecasting Stock Market Trends*  
- Built a **Time-Aware Heterogeneous KG Embedding** model using Transformers and GATs.  
- Achieved a **50% improvement** in return ratio and accuracy metrics.

I have also led applied projects in low-resource language translation, GANs, contrastive learning, and sequence-to-sequence NLP tasks. You can find the source code for many of these projects on my GitHub.

## Background & History

I earned my **B.Tech in Computer Science** from **RVR & JC College of Engineering**, graduating with a **9.08 CGPA**. Motivated by research and innovation, I secured **AIR 352 in GATE CSE 2023**, which enabled me to join **IISc Bangalore**.

Before transitioning to academia, I worked at **Cognizant**, where I:
- Migrated enterprise infrastructure to Microsoft Cloud.
- Designed and deployed web-based Audit Management Systems on AWS.

This blend of industry experience and academic training drives my passion for solving complex, real-world problems with cutting-edge AI.


## Intellectual Communities

I‚Äôve had the privilege of being part of several intellectual and collaborative spaces:

- üß† **StatsML Lab, IISc**  
  Working on **transformers, GNNs**, and **temporal modeling** under Prof. Ambedkar Dukkipati.

- Contributor to open-source projects in LLMs and knowledge-graph-based learning.

- üßë‚Äçüè´ **Teaching Assistant at IISc**  
  - E0 270: Machine Learning  
  - E0 294: Systems for Machine Learning
